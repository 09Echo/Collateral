## Collateral Scoring on CT Angiography
### Skull-stripping
  
After converting the DICOM files to NIfTI format, perform skull stripping according to the instructions at https://github.com/WuChanada/StripSkullCT.  <br />

### Training  
```
python train.py --save-path <Path> --num-classes <Classes>
```
Parameter Descriptionï¼š  
* --save-path <Path>: Model save path, please specify a valid directory
* --num-classes <Classes>: Classification category, please specify a positive integer, such as 3

### Testing  

### Reproduction details and codes
During reproduction, for the CNN-based methods, Transformer-based methods, and Hybrid-CNN-Transformer-based methods. All of these methods can be found at [[Baseline]](./baseline).  <br />
Note that for all compared methods, to perform fair comparisons, we used the same data split and five-fold cross-validation.  <br />
